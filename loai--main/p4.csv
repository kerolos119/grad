 The culprit survives harsh winters on fallen leaves, then releases airborne spores in spring that infect young leaves and fruit. 
These infections manifest as olive-green, velvety lesions that grow and turn black, distorting the fruit and causing premature leaf drop.
 While rarely fatal, apple scab significantly reduces fruit quality and weakens the tree.","Choose scab-resistant apple varieties when planting. 
Prune trees to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration. 
Rake and remove fallen leaves in the fall to reduce overwintering fungal spores. 
Apply fungicides as preventative sprays before bud break and during the growing season, especially during cool, wet weather.","If symptoms appear, fungicides can still be effective, but early intervention is crucial. 
Follow the instructions and timing recommendations on the specific fungicide product you choose. 
Remove and destroy severely infected fruits and leaves to prevent further spread."

Infected apples develop large, sunken brown patches that spread with concentric rings.
 These lesions can engulf the entire fruit, leaving behind a mummified husk.
 The fungus survives in these mummies and branch cankers, releasing spores during wet weather to infect leaves, causing 'frog-eye' spots, and initiating the cycle anew.
 While not always fatal, black rot significantly reduces fruit quality and weakens the tree.","Choose resistant varieties, prune trees for good air circulation, and remove fallen debris. 
Avoid wounding the fruits during harvest. 
Apply fungicides as preventative sprays before bud break and during the growing season.","Prune and remove infected branches during the dormant season.

On apple trees, it manifests as yellow to orange leaf spots with orange, horn-like structures erupting underneath. 
These structures release spores that infect nearby junipers, causing the formation of round, brown galls. In spring, these galls erupt, releasing spores that re-infect apple trees, perpetuating the cycle. Though rarely fatal, the disease disfigures apples and weakens both trees.","Plant apple trees away from juniper trees (the alternate host for the fungus). 
Remove juniper trees in the vicinity of your orchard if possible. 
Apply fungicides during the early stages of leaf development.","Prune and remove infected branches during the dormant season. 
Fungicides may be applied, but timing is crucial for effectiveness.

A magnifying glass can be helpful. Color variation: They can be yellow, green, brown, or reddish, often with two darker spots on their bodies (hence the name ""two-spotted spider mite""). Location: Primarily found on the undersides of leaves, where they feed on plant sap. In severe infestations, they may also be visible on the upper leaf surface. Movement: Slow-moving but can be seen crawling on the leaves. Indirect signs on leaves: Stippling: Tiny, yellow or bronze-colored stippling on the upper leaf surface, caused by mites piercing the leaves to feed. Webbing: Fine webbing on the undersides of leaves, particularly around leaf veins where mites congregate, as the infestation progresses. Leaf discoloration: Yellowing, bronzing, or browning of leaves, eventually leading to withering and dropping.","Regular monitoring: Regularly inspect the undersides of leaves for mites or signs of damage. Watering practices: Avoid water stress by providing consistent moisture to your tomato plants. Beneficial insects: Encourage ladybugs, lacewings, and predatory mites, natural enemies of spider mites, to control their populations. Resistant varieties: Choose tomato varieties known to be resistant to spider mites if available","Insecticidal soap: Spray directly on the mites, especially in early infestations. Organic pesticides: Neem oil or horticultural oil can be used for control. Predatory mites: Introduce commercially available predatory mites for long-term biological control. Insecticides: In severe cases, chemical insecticides may be necessary, but use them carefully considering potential harm to beneficial insects and follow application instructions strictly."
